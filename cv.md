## Example Code

```
function whoseBicycle(diary1, diary2, diary3) {
  // good luck
    const one = Object.values(diary1).reduce((a, b) => { return a + b });
  const two = Object.values(diary2).reduce((a, b) => { return a + b });
  const three = Object.values(diary3).reduce((a, b) => { return a + b })

  if (one > two && one > three) {
    return 'I need to buy a bicycle for my first son.' // the sum of the marks is the highest  in the first diary.
  }
  if (two > one && two > three) {
    return 'I need to buy a bicycle for my second son.' // the sum of the marks is the highest  in the second diary.
  }
  if (three > one && three > two) {
    return 'I need to buy a bicycle for my third son.' // the sum of the marks is the highest  in the third diary.
  }
  if (three === one || three === two) {
    return 'I need to buy a bicycle for my third son.' // the sum of the marks is the highest  in the third diary.
  }
}
